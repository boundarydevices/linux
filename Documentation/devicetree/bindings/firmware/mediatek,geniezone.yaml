description:
  GenieZone is a proprietary type-I hypervisor firmware developed by MediaTek,
  providing an isolated execution environment for mTEE (MediaTek Trusted
  Execution Environment) and AVF (Android Virtualization Framework) virtual
  machines. This binding facilitates the integration of GenieZone into the
  Android Virtualization Framework (AVF) with Crosvm as the VMM. The driver
  exposes hypervisor control interfaces to the VMM for managing virtual
  machine lifecycles and assisting virtual device emulation.
