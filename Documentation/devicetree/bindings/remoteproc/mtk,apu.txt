MT8183 Vision Processor Unit (VPU) devices
=======================

DSP Device Node:
================
Each DSP Core sub-system is represented as a single DT node.

Required properties:
--------------------
The following are the mandatory properties:

- compatible:		Should be one of the following,
			    "mediatek,mt8183-apu" for DSPs on MT8183 SoCs
- reg:			Should contain an entry for each value in 'reg-names'.
			Each entry should have the memory region's start address
			and the size of the region, the representation matching
			the parent node's '#address-cells' and '#size-cells' values.
- reg-names:		Should contain strings with the following names, each
			representing a specific internal memory region or a
			specific register space. Should be "mmio".
- interrupts:		The interrupt number used to receive the interrupts
			from the DSP.
- clocks:		Clocks for co-processor (See: ../clock/clock-bindings.txt)
			Three clocks are expected for AXI, IPU and JTAG.
			The JTAG clock seems to be required to run the DSP,
			even when JTAG is not in use.
- clock-names:		The name of clocks, must be ipu, axi and jtag
- iommu:		IOMMU (See: ../iommu/iommu.txt)
- memory-region:	Reserved memory (See: ../reserved-memory/reserved-memory.txt)
- power-domains:	Power domain (see: ../power/power_domain.txt)

Optional properties:
--------------------
pinctrl-0, pinctrl-1:	pinctrl handles, required to configure pins for JTAG.
pinctrl-names:		pinctrl name, must be "default", "jtag".
			"default" must configure the pins when JTAG is disabled.
			"jtag" must configure the pins for JTAG operations.

Example:
--------

	reserved-memory {
		#address-cells = <1>;
		#size-cells = <1>;
		ranges;

		vpu_ram: vpu_ram@0x60000000 {
			compatible = "shared-dma-pool";
			reg = <0 0x60000000 0 0x040000000>;
			no-map;
			linux,cma-default;
		};
	};

	vpu0: vpu@0x19100000 {
		compatible = "mediatek,mt8183-apu";
		reg = <0 0x19180000 0 0x14000>;
		reg-names = "mmio";
		interrupts = <GIC_SPI 292 IRQ_TYPE_LEVEL_LOW>;

		iommus = <&iommu M4U_PORT_IMG_IPUO>,
			 <&iommu M4U_PORT_IMG_IPU3O>,
			 <&iommu M4U_PORT_IMG_IPUI>;

		clocks = <&ipu_core0 CLK_IPU_CORE0_AXI>,
			 <&ipu_core0 CLK_IPU_CORE0_IPU>,
			 <&ipu_core0 CLK_IPU_CORE0_JTAG>;

		clock-names = "axi", "ipu", "jtag";

		power-domains = <&scpsys MT8183_POWER_DOMAIN_VPU_CORE0>;
		memory-region = <&vpu_ram>;
	};
