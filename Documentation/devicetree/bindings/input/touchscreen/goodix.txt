Device tree bindings for Goodix GT9xx series touchscreen controller

Required properties:

 - compatible		: Should be "goodix,gt911"
				 or "goodix,gt9110"
				 or "goodix,gt912"
				 or "goodix,gt927"
				 or "goodix,gt9271"
				 or "goodix,gt928"
				 or "goodix,gt967"
 - reg			: I2C address of the chip. Should be 0x5d or 0x14
 - interrupt-parent	: Interrupt controller to which the chip is connected
 - interrupts		: Interrupt to which the chip is connected
 - gpios		: GPIOS the chip is connected to: first one is the
			  interrupt gpio and second one the reset gpio.
Optional properties:

 - esd-recovery-timeout-ms : ESD poll time (in milli seconds) for the driver to
                            check if ESD occurred and in that case reset the
                            device. ESD is disabled if this property is not set
                            or is set to 0.

Example:

	i2c@00000000 {
		/* ... */

		gt928@5d {
			compatible = "goodix,gt928";
			reg = <0x5d>;
			interrupt-parent = <&gpio>;
			interrupts = <0 0>;

			gpios = <&gpio1 0 0>, /* INT */
				<&gpio1 1 0>; /* RST */
		};

		/* ... */
	};
