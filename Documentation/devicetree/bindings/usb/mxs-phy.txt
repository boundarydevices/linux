* Freescale MXS USB Phy Device

Required properties:
- compatible: Should be "fsl,imx23-usbphy"
- reg: Should contain registers location and length
- interrupts: Should contain phy interrupt
- usbphy_reg_at_anatop: if there is any registers at anatop domain
- usbphy_need_disconnect_line_feature: at some platforms (like i.mx6),
if both phys power is off, the status of dp/dm will be uncertain.
At that time, there will be unknown wakeup. With this flag, we can
avoid this unknown wakeup interrupt


Example:
usbphy1: usbphy@020c9000 {
	compatible = "fsl,imx6q-usbphy", "fsl,imx23-usbphy";
	reg = <0x020c9000 0x1000>;
	interrupts = <0 44 0x04>;
	usbphy_reg_at_anatop;
	usbphy_need_disconnect_line_feature;
};
