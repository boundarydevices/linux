KVM MMIO guard
==============

KVM implements device emulation by handling translation faults to any
IPA range that is not contained in a memory slot. Such a translation
fault is in most cases passed on to userspace (or in rare cases to the
host kernel) with the address, size and possibly data of the access
for emulation.

Should the guest exit with an address that is not one that corresponds
to an emulatable device, userspace may take measures that are not the
most graceful as far as the guest is concerned (such as terminating it
or delivering a fatal exception).

There is also an element of trust: by forwarding the request to
userspace, the kernel assumes that the guest trusts userspace to do
the right thing.

The KVM MMIO guard offers a way to mitigate this last point: a guest
can request that only certain regions of the IPA space are valid as
MMIO. Only these regions will be handled as an MMIO, and any other
will result in an exception being delivered to the guest.

This relies on a set of hypercalls defined in the KVM-specific range,
using the HVC64 calling convention.

When operating on a range of contiguous IPA space, it is recommended
to use ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_MMIO_RGUARD_MAP and
ARM_SMCCC_KVM_FUNC_MMIO_RGUARD_UNMAP. Those HVCs take a number of
granules as an argument. See ``KVM_FUNC_HAS_RANGE`` in hypercalls.rst
for a complete description.
