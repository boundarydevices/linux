	  The watchdog timer in an IMX6 processor can call an
	  interrupt a few seconds before it reboots.  However, if
	  interrupts have been disabled, this won't work.

	  Activating this feature allows an interrupt to be rerouted
	  through the FIQ interrupt vector, which is not affected by
	  the normal irq disable functions.  This feature does not do
	  any watchdog or other necessary rerouting, it only enables it
	  to be done in the watchdog (or wherever else true FIQ interrupts
	  are desired).

	  If you're not debugging low-level interrupt routines, you
	  probably don't need this feature.

	  Don't disable the wakeup irq when enabling the uart clock.  This will
	  cause extra interrupts, but it makes the serial debugger usable with

	  collapse.
