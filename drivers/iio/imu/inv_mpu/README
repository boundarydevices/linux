Description
===========
This document describes how to install the Invensense device driver into a
Linux kernel. The supported chips are listed in Kconfig and user selects an
appropriate one from .e.g. menuconfig.


Integrating the Driver in the Linux Kernel
==========================================
Please add the files as follows (kernel 3.10):
- Copy mpu.h to <kernel_root>/include/linux/iio/imu/
- Copy inv_mpu folder under <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/

In order to see the driver in menuconfig when building the kernel, please
make modifications as shown below:

    add "source "drivers/iio/imu/inv_mpu/Kconfig""
      in <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/Kconfig

    add "obj-y += inv_mpu/"
      in <kernel_root>/drivers/iio/imu/Makefile



Dts file
========
In order to recognize the Invensense device on the I2C/SPI bus, dts(or dtsi)
file must be modified.

Example)
ICM20648 + AK09911/BMP280/APDS9930 on AUX I2C

    i2c@f9968000 {
        /* Invensense */

            reg = <0x68>;
            interrupt-parent = <&msmgpio>;
            interrupts = <73 0x2>;
            inven,vdd_ana-supply = <&pm8941_l17>;
            inven,vcc_i2c-supply = <&pm8941_lvs1>;

            inven,secondary_name = "ak09911";
            inven,secondary_axis_map_x = <1>;
            inven,secondary_axis_map_y = <0>;
            inven,secondary_axis_map_z = <2>;
            inven,secondary_negate_x = <1>;
            inven,secondary_negate_y = <1>;
            inven,secondary_negate_z = <1>;
            /* If no pressure sensor,
             * replace "pressure" with "none"
             */
            inven,aux_type = "pressure";
            inven,aux_name = "bmp280";
            inven,aux_reg = <0x76>;
            /* If no ALS sensor
             * replace "als" with "none"
             */
            inven,read_only_slave_type = "als";
            inven,read_only_slave_name = "apds9930";
            inven,read_only_slave_reg = <0x39>;
        };
    };


Communicating with the Driver in Userspace
==========================================
The driver generates several files in sysfs upon installation.
These files are used to communicate with the driver. The files can be found at:

(I2C) /sys/devices/*.i2c/i2c-*/*-*/iio:device*
(SPI) /sys/devices/*.spi/spi_master/spi*/spi*.*/iio:device*

Group and Owner for all entries should be updated to system/system at
boot time to allow userspace to access properly.
