	  This module adds support for PCIe wireless adapters based on Broadcom
	  IEEE802.11n SoftMAC chipsets. If you choose to build a module, the

	  The brcmsmac LED support depends on the presence of the
	  BCMA_DRIVER_GPIO driver, and it only works if LED support
	  is enabled and reachable from the driver module.

	  If you say Y here, the Broadcom wireless drivers will register
	  with ftrace to dump event information into the trace ringbuffer.
	  Tracing can be enabled at runtime to aid in debugging wireless
	  issues. This option adds a small amount of overhead when tracing
	  is disabled. If unsure, say Y to allow developers to better help
	  you when wireless problems occur.
