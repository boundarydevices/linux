	  This is the option for MediaTek thermal software solutions.
	  Please enable corresponding options to get temperature
	  information from thermal sensors or turn on throttle
	  mechaisms for thermal mitigation.

	depends on HAS_IOMEM
	help
	  Enable this option if you want to get SoC temperature
	  information for MediaTek platforms.
	  This driver configures thermal controllers to collect
	  temperature via AUXADC interface.

        help
          Enable this option if you want to get SoC temperature
          information for supported MediaTek platforms.
          This driver configures LVTS (Low Voltage Thermal Sensor)
          thermal controllers to collect temperatures via ASIF
          (Analog Serial Interface).

	help
	  Enable this option if you want to get PMIC temperature
	  for MediaTek platforms.
	  This driver reads the voltage value from PMIC AUXADC channels,
	  and converts raw value to PMIC temperature via PMIC efuse data.
