menuconfig ION
	bool "Ion Memory Manager"
	depends on HAVE_MEMBLOCK && HAS_DMA && MMU
	select GENERIC_ALLOCATOR
	select DMA_SHARED_BUFFER
	---help---
	  Chose this option to enable the ION Memory Manager,
	  used by Android to efficiently allocate buffers
	  from userspace that can be shared between drivers.
	  If you're not using Android its probably safe to
	  say N here.

config ION_SYSTEM_HEAP
	bool "Ion system heap"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable the Ion system heap. The system heap
	  is backed by pages from the buddy allocator. If in doubt, say Y.

config ION_CARVEOUT_HEAP
	bool "Ion carveout heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
	  Choose this option to enable carveout heaps with Ion. Carveout heaps
	  are backed by memory reserved from the system. Allocation times are
	  typically faster at the cost of memory not being used. Unless you
	  know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CHUNK_HEAP
	bool "Ion chunk heap support"
	depends on ION
	help
          Choose this option to enable chunk heaps with Ion. This heap is
	  similar in function the carveout heap but memory is broken down
	  into smaller chunk sizes, typically corresponding to a TLB size.
	  Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_CMA_HEAP
	bool "Ion CMA heap support"
	depends on ION && DMA_CMA
	help
	  Choose this option to enable CMA heaps with Ion. This heap is backed
	  by the Contiguous Memory Allocator (CMA). If your system has these
	  regions, you should say Y here.

config ION_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	bool "ION unmapped heap support"
	depends on ION && (ARM || ARM64)
	help
	  Choose this option to enable UNMAPPED heaps with Ion. This heap is
	  backed in specific memory pools, carveout from the Linux memory.
	  Unless you know your system has these regions, you should say N here.

config ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	bool "ION dummy driver define an ION unmapped heap"
	depends on ION_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	help
	  Dummy ION driver will create a unmapped heap from physical
	  location provided through CONFIG_ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_BASE and
	  CONFIG_ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_SIZE.

config ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_BASE
	hex "Physical base address of the ION unmapped heap"
	depends on ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	default 0
	help
	  Allows one the statically define an unmapped heap from the
	  ION dummy driver to exercice unamped heaps buffer managment.

config ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_SIZE
	hex "Physical byte size of the ION unmapped heap"
	depends on ION_DUMMY_UNMAPPED_HEAP
	default 0
	help
	  Allows one the statically define an unmapped heap from the
	  ION dummy driver to exercice unamped heaps buffer managment.
