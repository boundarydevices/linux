	  The Gunyah drivers are the helper interfaces that run in a guest VM
	  such as basic inter-VM IPC and signaling mechanisms, and higher level
	  services such as memory/device sharing, IRQ sharing, and so on.

	  Enable support for interacting with Gunyah on Qualcomm
	  platforms. Interaction with Qualcomm firmware requires
	  extra platform-specific support.

	  Say Y/M here to use Gunyah on Qualcomm platforms.

	  Enable kernel support for creating irqfds which can raise an interrupt
	  on Gunyah virtual machine.

	  Say Y/M here if unsure and you want to support Gunyah VMMs.
