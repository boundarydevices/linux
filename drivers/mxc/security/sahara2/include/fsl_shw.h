 *
 * @section intro_sec Introduction
 *
 * This is the interface definition for the Freescale Security Hardware API
 * (FSL SHW API) for User Mode and Kernel Mode to access Freescale Security
 * Hardware components for cryptographic acceleration. The API is intended to
 * provide cross-platform access to security hardware components of Freescale.
 *
 * This documentation has not been approved, and should not be taken to
 * mean anything definite about future direction.
 *
 * Some example code is provided to give some idea of usage of this API.
 *
 * Note: This first version has been defined around the capabilities of the
 * Sahara2 cryptographic accelerator, and may be expanded in the future to
 * provide support for other platforms.  The Platform Capabilities Object is
 * intended as a way to allow programs to adapt to different platforms.
 *
 * The i.MX25 is an example of a platform without a SAHARA but yet has
 * capabilities supported by this API.  These include #fsl_shw_get_random() and
 * #fsl_shw_add_entropy(), and the use of Triple-DES (TDEA) cipher algorithm
 * (with no checking of key parity supported) in ECB and CBC modes with @ref
 * sym_sec.  See also the @ref di_sec for information on key handling, and @ref
 * td_sec for detection of Tamper Events.  Only the random functions are
 * available from user space on this platform.
 *
 * @section usr_ctx The User Context
 *
 * The User Context Object (#fsl_shw_uco_t) controls the interaction between
 * the user program and the API.  It is initialized as part of user
 * registration (#fsl_shw_register_user()), and is part of every interaction
 * thereafter.
 *
 * @section pf_sec Platform Capabilities
 *
 * Since this API is not tied to one specific type of hardware or even one
 * given version of a given type of hardware, the platform capabilities object
 * could be used by a portable program to make choices about using software
 * instead of hardware for certain operations.
 *
 * See the #fsl_shw_pco_t, returned by #fsl_shw_get_capabilities().
 *
 * @ref pcoops are provided to query its contents.
 *
 *
 * @section sym_sec Symmetric-Key Encryption and Decryption
 *
 * Symmetric-Key encryption support is provided for the block cipher algorithms
 * AES, DES, and Triple DES.  Modes supported are #FSL_SYM_MODE_ECB,
 * #FSL_SYM_MODE_CBC, and #FSL_SYM_MODE_CTR, though not necessarily all modes
 * for all algorithms.  There is also support for the stream cipher algorithm
 * commonly known as ARC4.
 *
 * Encryption and decryption are performed by using the functions
 * #fsl_shw_symmetric_encrypt() and #fsl_shw_symmetric_decrypt(), respectively.
 * There are two objects which provide information about the operation of these
 * functions.  They are the #fsl_shw_sko_t, to provide key and algorithm
 * information; and the #fsl_shw_scco_t, to provide (and store) initial context
 * or counter value information.
 *
 * CCM is not supported by these functions.  For information CCM support, see
 * @ref cmb_sec.
 *
 *
 * @section hash_sec Cryptographic Hashing
 *
 * Hashing is performed by fsl_shw_hash(). Control of the function is through
 * flags in the #fsl_shw_hco_t.  The algorithms which are
 * supported are listed in #fsl_shw_hash_alg_t.
 *
 * The hashing function works on octet streams.  If a user application needs to
 * hash a bitstream, it will need to do its own padding of the last block.
 *
 *
 * @section hmac_sec Hashed Message Authentication Codes
 *
 * An HMAC is a method of combining a hash and a key so that a message cannot
 * be faked by a third party.
 *
 * The #fsl_shw_hmac() can be used by itself for one-shot or multi-step
 * operations, or in combination with #fsl_shw_hmac_precompute() to provide the
 * ability to compute and save the beginning hashes from a key one time, and
 * then use #fsl_shw_hmac() to calculate an HMAC on each message as it is
 * processed.
 *
 * The maximum key length which is directly supported by this API is 64 octets.
 * If a longer key size is needed for HMAC, the user will have to hash the key
 * and present the digest value as the key to be used by the HMAC functions.
 *
 *
 * @section rnd_sec Random Numbers
 *
 * Support is available for acquiring random values from a
 * cryptographically-strong random number generator.  See
 * #fsl_shw_get_random().  The function #fsl_shw_add_entropy() may be used to
 * add entropy to the random number generator.
 *
 *
 * @section cmb_sec Combined Cipher and Authentication
 *
 * Some schemes require that messages be encrypted and that they also have an
 * authentication code associated with the message. The function
 * #fsl_shw_gen_encrypt() will generate the authentication code and encrypt the
 * message.
 *
 * Upon receipt of such a message, the message must be decrypted and the
 * authentication code validated.  The function
 * #fsl_shw_auth_decrypt() will perform these steps.
 *
 * Only AES-CCM is supported.
 *
 *
 * @section wrap_sec Wrapped Keys
 *
 * On platforms with a Secure Memory, the function #fsl_shw_establish_key() can
 * be used to place a key into the System Keystore.  This key then can be used
 * directly by the cryptographic hardware.  It later then be wrapped
 * (cryptographically obscured) by #fsl_shw_extract_key() and stored for later
 * use.  If a software key (#FSL_SKO_KEY_SW_KEY) was established, then its
 * value can be retrieved with a call to #fsl_shw_read_key().
 *
 * The wrapping and unwrapping functions provide security against unauthorized
 * use and detection of tampering.
 *
 * The functions can also be used with a User Keystore.
 *
 * @section smalloc_sec Secure Memory Allocation
 *
 * On platforms with multiple partitions of Secure Memory, the function
 * #fsl_shw_smalloc() can be used to acquire a partition for private use.  The
 * function #fsl_shw_diminish_perms() can then be used to revoke specific
 * permissions on the partition, and #fsl_shw_sfree() can be used to release the
 * partition.
 *
 * @section keystore_sec User Keystore
 *
 * User Keystore functionality is defined in fsl_shw_keystore.h.  See @ref
 * user_keystore for details.  This is not supported on platforms without SCC2.
 *
 * @section di_sec Hardware key-select extensions - DryIce
 *
 * Some platforms have a component called DryIce which allows the software to
 * control which key will be used by the secure memory encryption hardware.
 * The choices are the secret per-chip Fused (IIM) Key, an unknown, hardware-
 * generated Random Key, a software-written Programmed Key, or the IIM Key in
 * combination with one of the others.  #fsl_shw_pco_check_pk_supported() can
 * be used to determine whether this feature is available on the platform.
 * The rest of this section will explain the symmetric ciphering and key
 * operations which are available on such a platform.
 *
 * The function #fsl_shw_sko_init_pf_key() will set up a Secret Key Object to
 * refer to one of the system's platform keys.  All keys which reference a
 * platform key must use this initialization function, including a user-
 * provided key value.  Keys which are intended for software encryption must
 * use #fsl_shw_sko_init().
 *
 * To change the setting of the Programmed Key of the DryIce module,
 * #fsl_shw_establish_key() must be called with a platform key object of type
 * #FSL_SHW_PF_KEY_PRG or #FSL_SHW_PF_KEY_IIM_PRG.  The key will be go
 * into the PK register of DryIce and not to the keystore.  Any symmetric
 * operation which references either #FSL_SHW_PF_KEY_PRG or
 * #FSL_SHW_PF_KEY_IIM_PRG will use the current PK value (possibly modified by
 * the secret fused IIM key).  Before the Flatform Key can be changed, a call to
 * #fsl_shw_release_key() or #fsl_shw_extract_key() must be made.  Neither
 * function will change the value in the PK registers, and further ciphering
 * can take place.
 *
 * When #fsl_shw_establish_key() is called to change the PK value, a plaintext
 * key can be passed in with the #FSL_KEY_WRAP_ACCEPT argument or a previously
 * wrapped key can be passed in with the #FSL_KEY_WRAP_UNWRAP argument.  If
 * #FSL_KEY_WRAP_CREATE is passed in, then a random value will be loaded into
 * the PK register.  The PK value can be wrapped by a call to
 * #fsl_shw_extract_key() for later use with the #FSL_KEY_WRAP_UNWRAP argument.
 *
 * As an alternative to using only the fused key for @ref wrap_sec,
 * #fsl_shw_uco_set_wrap_key() can be used to select either the random key or
 * the random key with the fused key as the key which will be used to protect
 * the one-time value used to wrap the key.  This allows for these
 * wrapped keys to be dependent upon and therefore unrecoverable after a tamper
 * event causes the erasure of the DryIce Random Key register.
 *
 * The software can request that the hardware generate a (new) Random Key for
 * DryIce by calling #fsl_shw_gen_random_pf_key().
 *
 *
 * @section td_sec Device Tamper-Detection
 *
 * Some platforms have a component which can detect certain types of tampering
 * with the hardware.  #fsl_shw_read_tamper_event() API will allow the
 * retrieval of the type of event which caused a tamper-detection failure.
 *
